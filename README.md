## Why Media Inventory Forge?

Every WordPress site accumulates media files over time, but understanding what you have, where storage is being consumed, and which files may need attention becomes nearly impossible without proper analysis tools. Media Inventory Forge provides comprehensive inventory and reporting of your entire media library with detailed visualizations and exportable data.

**Important:** MIF is a read-only analysis tool. It scans and reports on your media files but does not modify, optimize, compress, resize, or delete any files. Always maintain backups before using other tools to act on MIF data.

### Perfect For
- **WordPress Developers** conducting detailed media audits for client sites
- **Agency Teams** managing multiple WordPress installations efficiently
- **Site Administrators** analyzing storage usage and planning cleanup strategies
- **Performance Specialists** gathering data to identify optimization opportunities
- **WordPress Professionals** needing comprehensive media library documentation

## Using MIF Data for Optimization Planning

Media Inventory Forge provides the data foundation for optimization decisions. Here's how the insights can inform your strategy:

| What MIF Reports | How to Use This Data |
|------------------|----------------------|
| Original vs. generated sizes | Identify candidates for format conversion (WEBP, AVIF) |
| Large uncompressed files | Plan compression workflows with other tools |
| WordPress size distribution | Decide which thumbnail sizes to keep or remove |
| Format distribution | Identify legacy formats needing modernization |

*Note: Use MIF data with separate optimization tools. MIF only reports - it does not perform optimizations.*

### WordPress Size Categories
```
Example WordPress Image Size Distribution:
├── Thumbnails (≤150px): 245 files = 1.8 MB
├── Small (151-300px): 89 files = 3.2 MB
├── Medium (301-768px): 156 files = 12.4 MB
├── Large (769-1024px): 67 files = 8.9 MB
├── Extra Large (1025-1536px): 34 files = 15.2 MB
└── Super Large (>1536px): 23 files = 45.6 MB
```
